## Notes

- 1: Redux Store has been used for cart and favorite.
- 2: In some cases, I did not maintain pixel perfect design as by eye-sight it looked not perfect.
- 3: DaisyUi is installed but I have not used it as the design is best suit for custom css.
- 4: It could have been developed using NextJs which is my favorite but the present design demands using ReactJs.
- 4: I did not use RTK Query as there is only GET api to integrate.
